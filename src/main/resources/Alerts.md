# Status events
The /alerts GET method allows you to automatically retrieve events for parcels and shipments. This information can be useful for tracking, statistics, quality measurements etc. The information this method returns contains events received from the carriers and also the timestamp indicating when the change in the event has occurred. All the events are reported and named as "alerts" in this document.
